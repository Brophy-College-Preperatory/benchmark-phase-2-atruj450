            <h2>Affects of Difference of Medicine on the World</h2>
            <p>Medicine has had a profound impact on the world, transforming how we live and increasing life expectancy. Over the centuries, the development of medical knowledge and treatments has helped reduce the spread of diseases, cure illnesses, and alleviate pain. Vaccines, for example, have eradicated deadly diseases like smallpox and drastically reduced the impact of others, such as polio. Antibiotics have saved countless lives by treating infections that once claimed the lives of many. As a result, people today live longer, healthier lives, and the overall quality of life has improved for billions of people around the globe.

                However, medicine also has some challenges and consequences that affect society. The rapid development of new drugs and treatments can be expensive, often creating disparities in access to healthcare. Some countries and communities cannot afford the latest medical advancements, leading to inequalities in health outcomes. Additionally, overuse of certain medications, like antibiotics, can lead to resistance, making them less effective. There are also ethical concerns surrounding medical practices, such as the use of stem cells or genetic editing. While medicine has improved the world in many ways, these challenges highlight the complexities and responsibilities that come with its power.</p>
