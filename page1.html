            <h2>Traditional Medicine</h2>
            <p>Traditional medicine refers to the healing practices and treatments that have been used by various cultures for centuries. Unlike modern medicine, which often relies on advanced technology and pharmaceutical drugs, traditional medicine is based on natural remedies, such as herbs, plants, and other natural substances. It also includes practices like acupuncture, massage, and spiritual healing. Many of these treatments are passed down through generations, often within families or communities, and are deeply connected to cultural beliefs and values. While traditional medicine is still widely used in many parts of the world, it is often combined with modern medicine to offer a more holistic approach to health and wellness.</p>

            <h2>Alternative Medicine</h2>
            <p>Alternative medicine refers to a range of treatments and therapies that are used instead of traditional medical practices. These approaches often focus on natural healing methods, like using herbs, acupuncture, chiropractic care, or mind-body techniques such as yoga and meditation. Unlike conventional medicine, which is based on scientific research and treatments like prescription drugs or surgery, alternative medicine emphasizes a more holistic view of health, considering the physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being of a person. People turn to alternative medicine for various reasons, such as seeking fewer side effects or looking for natural ways to improve their health. However, it is important to note that some alternative treatments may lack scientific evidence of their effectiveness, so it's always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before trying them.</p>

            <h2>Modern Medicine</h2>
            <p>Modern medicine is a branch of healthcare that uses the latest scientific research, technology, and medical practices to diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases. It involves a wide range of treatments, from prescription medications and surgeries to advanced technologies like MRI scans and robotic surgeries. Modern medicine is based on evidence and is continually improving through ongoing studies and clinical trials. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals use their knowledge of biology, chemistry, and other sciences to develop effective treatments and care plans for patients. Thanks to modern medicine, many diseases that were once deadly can now be treated or managed, and life expectancy has increased significantly around the world.</p>
